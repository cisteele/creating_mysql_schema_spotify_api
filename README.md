# Creating a MySQL schema for the spotify api
Creates a schema of table in a local MySQL database by aggregating data from the Spotify API.


## mysql_credentials.txt
This text file contains the credentials to connect to a local mysql database.  Be sure to update the values in the right column (user, password, host, database) with your servers details.

mysql_user user
mysql_pw password
mysql_host host
mysql_db database


## spotify_credentials.txt
This text file contains the credentials to connect to a the Spotify API.  Be sure to update the values in the right column (cid, secret) with your Sppotify developer details.

client_id cid
client_secret secret


## playlist_urls.txt
This text file contains the urls of all playlists to scrape for songs to add to the database.  By default the file contains two playlist urls, "Techno 2020" and "Deep House 2020".  Replace these with your preffered playlist urls.  The specific form of the beginning of the url is unimportant, but the url must end with ".../playlist/<playlist_id>" where <playlist_id> is a string of 22 characters.  


## create_mysql_table_spotify.py
This python script will read the three test files, scrape the desired playlists from the spotify API, and create the "track", "artist", and "album" tables in the specified mysql database.  An error will occur if there are any tables with those names in the database already. 

This python script requires spotipy, pymysql, and sqlalchemy.
